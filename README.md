# Caesar Cipher App
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher App, where you can encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher technique. This app allows you to encode or decode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain amount. Enhance your understanding of cryptography while having fun with this simple yet effective encryption method.

# How to Use
Run the program using a Python interpreter (Python 3 recommended).
The app will prompt you to specify whether you want to 'encode' or 'decode' a message.
Enter the text message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Choose a shift value by entering an integer. The shift value determines how many positions each letter is shifted in the alphabet.
The app will display the encoded or decoded message based on your chosen shift and operation.
You can choose to run the app again with a new message or exit.

# Encryption and Decryption
Encode: Shifting the letters forward in the alphabet by the specified shift value.
Decode: Shifting the letters backward in the alphabet by the specified shift value.

# Example Usage
Type 'encode' to encrypt, Type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
5
The encoded text is: mjqqt

Do you want to run again? Type 'yes' or 'no':
yes
Type 'encode' to encrypt, Type 'decode' to decrypt:
decode
Type your message:
mjqqt
Type the shift number:
5
The decoded text is: hello

Do you want to run again? Type 'yes' or 'no':
no
Goodbye.

# Tips
Keep track of the shift value used for encryption or decryption to ensure proper decoding.
Experiment with different shift values to see how they affect the message.

# How to Run
Save the code to a .py file (e.g., caesar_cipher_app.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
Run the program by entering python caesar_cipher_app.py.

Enhance your knowledge of cryptography with the Caesar Cipher App and encrypt or decrypt messages using this classic technique!
